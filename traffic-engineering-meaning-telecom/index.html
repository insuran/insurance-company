Industrial Edge Applications for Traffic Signal Systems From blog.schneider-electric.com
A traffic engineer�s tasks are to conduct assessments of existing road. Traffic engineering is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on roadways. Traffic engineering is the subdiscipline of transportation engineering that addresses the planning, design and operation of streets and highways, their networks, adjacent. It is a proactive way of addressing congestion, allowing us time to prepare expansion resources.
