From venturebeat.com
In most situations when you hit another vehicle that is stationary and legally parked, you are 100 per cent at fault. If your accident causes $2,000 or more in combined damage (vehicles and property) then it must be reported. Usually, parking lot owners aren’t responsible for damage to cars that happens in the parking lot, signage or not. There is a lot of conflicting advice about what to do after a car wreck on private property.
